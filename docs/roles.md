## Escalation Protocol

When an agent encounters a situation outside their role:

1. **Stop** - Do not proceed with unauthorized actions
2. **Document** - Record what needs to be done
3. **Escalate** - Flag for the appropriate role
4. **Wait** - Do not assume approval

### Escalation Examples

| Situation | Escalate To |
|-----------|-------------|
| Need to change UI layout | Project Owner |
| Found architectural issue | Architecture Guardian |
| Need new dependency | Architecture Guardian |
| Performance issue | Refactor Agent |
| Need backend integration | Integration Engineer |
| Found bug | QA Agent |

---

## Role Assignment

Agents should self-identify their role at the start of each task:

```
Role: [Role Name]
Task: [Brief description]
Files: [Expected files to modify]
Risk: [Low/Medium/High]
```

This ensures accountability and proper scope management.
